            <h2>CSY1014 - Computer Systems</h2>
            <h2>Co-ordinator: Yinghui Zhang</h2>
            <p>This module provides basic knowledge of the hardware and software components that make up a computer system. Modern computer systems not only 
                consist of just the computer but also include a range of peripherals. The module gives an overview of all the important concepts in preparation 
                for a deeper study of computer systems.Learning environments are offered to enable students to gain a basic comprehension understanding and 
                appreciation of computer system concepts and technologies and the skills to use them to the best effect</p>

                This module provides basic knowledge of the hardware and software components that make up a computer communication. Modern computer network not 
                only consist of just the computer but also include a range of network devices. The module gives: an overview of all the important concepts in 
                preparation for a deeper study of computer communication; appropriate practical skills related to computer networking; a comprehensive and broad 
                understanding of the theory of computer networking.

            <h2>Co-ordinator: Thomas Butler</h2>
            <p>
                This purpose of this (Level 4) module is to give students an understanding of client side web technologies. This module provides students with: 
                the essential knowledge and practical skills to design develop and implement a Web site to contenporary web standard; an overview of the Internet 
                technologies the overall software architecture of the Internet including servers clients browsers is covered leading to the use of a Web server to 
                install maintain and publish Web Pages to achieve Web presence; standard client side dynamic web development environment such as HTML Cascading Style 
                Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript are covered in detail.

            <h2>CSY1023 - ICT Applications</h2>
            <h2>Co-ordinator: Jonathan Adams</h2>
            <p>
                This purpose of this module is to: introduce students to the skills principles and concepts necessary to solve problems in computing; to develop 
                essential skills to enable the solution of these problems with the construction of appropriate algorithms and a computer program; introduce principles 
                underlying the design of a high level programming language (HLPL); gain experience and confidence in the use of a HLPL to implement algorithms; 
                implement HLPL programs using an appropriate programming language e.g. Java; introduce an object-oriented language initially as a non-object language.

            <h2>Co-ordinator: Anastasios Bakaoukas</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of this module is to; introduce students to the skills principles and concepts necessary to develop computer games; develop essential programming 
                skills to enable the solution of these problems with the construction of appropriate algorithms and a games program; introduce principles underlying the design 
                of a high level programming language (HLPL) and development platforms; gain experience and confidence in the use of a HLPL and development platforms to implement 
                computer games; implement games programs using an appropriate HLPL and development platform; deliver the language as a non-object language; develop an appreciation 
                of the game development lifecycle and apply problem-solving skills to develop prototype games programs

            <h2>Co-ordinator: Vikaas Mistry</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of this module is ?To integrate and draw together the various aspects of the programme gained during study at level 4. The aim is that the shared Team 
                Project (ideally small groups of 3-6 students) is a vehicle for the students from both pathways to come together and to develop a 2D digital game that enriches their 
                individual pathway skills by exposure to requirements of the complementary pathway
